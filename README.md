#  An end to End AI Course Generation System

This project presents an AI-powered system designed to automate the generation of higher education academic courses using OpenAI's language models. It integrates advanced prompt engineering techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and automated fact verification to simplify, accelerate, and enhance the course development process for educators.

##  Objectives

- Develop an academic course generation pipeline tailored for higher education.
- Leverage prompt engineering to maximize the effectiveness of the ChatGPT model.
- Reduce the manual workload and time investment required for course design.
- Ensure academic accuracy and integrity through automated fact-checking.

##  System Overview

This system guides educators through a comprehensive pipeline:

1. **Course Outline Generation** – Automatically generates structured outlines for academic courses.
2. **Content Development** – Creates and refines lecture content (shorten, expand, paraphrase).
3. **Fact Verification** – Validates claims using:
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Wikipedia API for source retrieval
   - SentenceTransformers for semantic similarity analysis
   - A classification system: `Verified`, `Moderate`, or `Unverified`

##  Evaluation Metrics

The system’s output was evaluated using a set of NLP and LLM-informed metrics, for instance:

- **Contextual Relevance** – Evaluates how well content fits within the course scope.
- **Word Count Analysis** – Measures consistency and conciseness across content blocks.
- **Factual Accuracy** – Using the verification system to label information quality.
